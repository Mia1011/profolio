I've always dream to work in a global tech company. To fulfill my curiosity, I came up with an idea to explore the reasons influencing salaries within the tech industry. By analyzing a dataset from an anonymous tech company, I delve into the correlations between salary levels and various factors using R statistics and visulisation.
